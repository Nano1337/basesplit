BaseSplit is a smart bill-splitting tool that streamlines the process of sharing expenses with friends. Simply snap a photo of your physical bill, send it through iMessage, and BaseSplit automatically processes the image to generate and send cryptocurrency payment requests to your friends. With its automated workflow and crypto integration, BaseSplit makes splitting bills hassle-free and modern.
